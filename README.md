# Visual Algo

This repository is dedicated to visualizing data structures and algorithms. It is specially created as a companion resource for a YouTube playlist series where I explain and demonstrate various data structures and algorithms with visual examples.

## About

- **Purpose:** Help learners understand core concepts in data structures and algorithms through interactive and visual code examples.
- **YouTube Playlist:** The code and visualizations in this repo are featured in my upcoming YouTube playlist. Each video will reference specific files or folders here for hands-on learning.
- **Topics Covered:** Sorting algorithms, searching algorithms, trees, graphs, stacks, queues, and more.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/10d3/AMHerley.git
